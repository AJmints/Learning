Git commands

When updating the GitHub repository:

git status                      //This is seeing what is and isn't syncd to the online repository
git add //filename              //This is where you add the files you want to commit and push to the GitHub repository
git status                      //This is verifying that the files you want to sync and commit are qued up and ready
git commit -m "Type your required message here"         //This is where you commit the changes but haven't updated the GitHub repository yet
git push                        //This is when you update the GitHub repository



1. When you create a repository on your computer and want to upload it to your GitHub account, this is the process to do it.
First, create a new repository on GitHub and copy the link. 
In bash, type:

git remote add origin //link to new repository on github

git remote -v               //Check it by:

git push -u origin master   //Next step is to set up an upstream (connect the remote) so you can push without typing "git push origin master" every time:

Now you can type just "git push" when updating the repository on git:

refresh github and make sure your files copied over. 



2. I deleted a .js file from my computer on accident. I didn't commit the change and the GitHub repository still has the original file on it. I can restore my accidently deleted .js file by using this git command.

git checkout HEAD "this is the name of the file on github"
