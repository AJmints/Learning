create new repository on git hub and copy link

in bash, type

git remote add origin //link to new repository on github

check it by

git remote -v

next step is to set up an upstream (connect the remote) so you can push without typing origin master

git push -u origin master

now you can type just /git push/ when updating the repository

refresh github and make sure the readme.md copied over.
